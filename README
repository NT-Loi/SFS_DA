This package has the following requirements:

    numpy
    mpmath
    matplotlib
    scipy
    sklearn
    statsmodels

We recommend to install or update anaconda to the latest version and use Python 3 (We used Python 3.12.3).

NOTE: We use scipy package (version 1.13.1) to solve the linear program (simplex method). However, the default package does not return the set of basic variables. Therefore, we slightly modified the package so that it can return the set of basic variables by replacing the two files '_linprog.py' and '_linprog_simplex.py' in scipy.optimize module with our modified files in the folder 'files_to_replace'.
